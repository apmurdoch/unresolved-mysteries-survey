"Aunt Diane was a closet alcoholic (and stoner) and drunkenly wrecked the car. Her family is in deep, deep denial.",,https://reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/9014d6/can_we_have_an_agreedisagree_post_on_all_mysteries/e2ntggd/,210
,"I agree that she was an alcoholic and drug user. I DO think it's likely she had some kind of unprecedented medical/mental health event that precipitated her beginning to drive the wrong way and also her strange behavior on the phone call, and that whatever medical or mental health think was likely caused by or related to her extreme intoxication. Either a drug interaction, a stroke, a psychotic break or something. So in other words I agree that her being drunk ultimately caused the wreck but I think something else - CAUSED by her drinking but an additional medical event - may have contributed too.",,18
,Ten thousand percent agree,,31
,100% agree. Her husbands inability to accept this makes me sick. I think he owes it to his son to accept that the reason he is now disabled is his mothers fault. And I think he owes it to the family of his 3 nieces that were killed. And he owes it to his dead daughter too. ,,17

P. Diddy (aka puff daddy/Sean Combs) knows who killed Tupac and Biggie ,,https://reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/9014d6/can_we_have_an_agreedisagree_post_on_all_mysteries/e2n6cw6/,229

,We already know about that tho.  Recently confirmed again. Diddy offered some crips money to steal death row chains.  They jumped some guy and stole his chain. Tupac and crew then saw him at a boxing match and jumped him.  That guy got his crew together and they shot tupac about 40 minutes later.,,39

The deaths of Kris Kremers and Lisanne Froon were most likely an accident and are not too suspicious. The location of the backpack and the condition of the belongings inside when found is suspicious,,https://reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/9014d6/can_we_have_an_agreedisagree_post_on_all_mysteries/e2n62vc/,27
,"It's definitely suspicous that their bodies were pulverized into tiny pieces on a 2 km stretch of river over the space of 2 months with no flesh left on the bodies and a lack of large predators that could have scavenged them in the area. Their own ME office says that they were treating the deaths as homicides before the government shut them down, and that they had never pulled bodies in that condition out of the river after such a short time, they should have been more or less intact with tons of flesh. 

The tour guide they met with that day has a reputation for being a total creep and lives a few miles away from where they were found. ",,4

"The WM3 investigation was botched and it's impossible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt they committed the crime based on the evidence that remains. They weren't given a fair trial and the prosecution didn't have the evidence to be confident in another conviction. Thus, guilty or not (I have no opinion), their release from prison with an Alford plea was warranted.

All of the above also goes for Michael Peterson.

Edit: pretty sure the point of this post is to comment ""disagree"" if you don't agree with a comment instead of downvoting to disagree. I see this happening with a few other comments as well as my own. This may come as a shock, but most of these comments will feature controversial opinions. That's the entire point.

**[Dupont de Ligonnès murders and disappearance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dupont_de_Ligonnès_murders_and_disappearance)**
>The Dupont de Ligonnès murders and disappearance involved the murder of five members of the same family in Nantes, in the département of Loire-Atlantique in north-western France, followed by the disappearance of the father of the family. Agnès Dupont de Ligonnès and her four children were murdered in early April 2011. Their bodies were found on 21 April 2011 at their home in Nantes. The father, Xavier Dupont de Ligonnès, disappeared at the same time and is considered the prime suspect in their murders. He is the subject of an international arrest warrant.

I will be updating this as possible. Feel free to pick up in comments with your favorite media related to the case. Will do 3 cases per comment. 

Brandon Lawson

Short summary: 26 year old oil worker from Texas, , four kids, common law relationship. He left his house in the middle of the night after an argument and told family he was planning to go to his parents’ house. He called 911 asking for police assistance in a very hard to understand call that’s publicly available. His vehicle was found, but there’s been no trace of him.

Generation Why and Trace Evidence both have great episodes on his case, as do a few other podcasts. 

Elisa Lam

Short summary: 
Elisa Lam (bite me, Siri dictation. LAM tyvm) was a Canadian woman of Cantonese descent who died while visiting Los Angeles. Her cause of death was drowning. The circumstances are very unusual, as the hotel where she died has a bad reputation and there is strange security footage of her behavior the night before she went missing. Her body was found in a water tower on the roof of the hotel, and there is a lot of speculation that there was foul play involved. 

Reddit link of many:
https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/3amnrx/resolved_elisa_lam_long_link_heavy/

There are thousands of True Crime shows, podcasts or videos, that cover the case. One of my favorite ones is LordenARTS on youtube. 

Johnny Gosch

Short summary: 
(oh man here we go) He was a 12 year old boy who was abducted in the early morning during prep work for his paper route. He has never been found. A young man came forward years later with a story that he and Johnny were both involved in a child sex ring. Johnny’s mother is an advocate for other families of missing children, and admitted under oath to have been visited by a person she believed to be her son. The whole case is controversial as fuck, but is a genuine missing child case, if nothing else. 

Reddit post among many:
https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/64e7qo/do_you_believe_noreen_gosch_was_visited_by_her/?st=JJSQU81W&sh=3687e6c5

There’s a great, hard to watch documentary about the case called Who Took Johnny. As of 2017 it was on Netflix but I don’t know, now.
